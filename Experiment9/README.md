# Experiment 9

1. WAJP to demonstrate multiple inheritance through default method (using interface)

2. Create an abstract class shape. Its implementation is provided by Rectangle and Circle class. Object of the implementation class returns the instance of the class.

3. Create an abstract class Shape with methods Calc-area and Calc-vol. Define 4 classes Sphere(radius), cone(r,h), cylinder(r,h), and box(l,b,h). Calculate area & volume of all using method overriding.

4. To demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing by taking all the primitive datatypes.
