# Experiment 5

1. WAJP to find the area of circle, cone, and cylinder by using Contructor Overloading.

2. WAJP to create a triangle class with contructors (no-arguement and parametrized) having instance variables to record its 3 sides. Write validate() method, to check for valid input. Use findArea() and findPerimeter() of the Triangle class object.

3. write a program to create a class Rectangle with default constructor, one argument constructor, and two argument constructors, and define the methods area and perimeter of the rectangle. create three different objects with help of three different constructors and print the area and perimeter of those objects

4. Define a class called Room with the following attributes 1. length, 2. breadth, 3. height, 4. floor area, 5. Wall area, 6. No.of fans, 7. no of windows, 8. no of doors. Define suitable contructor & a method to display details of a room. Assume that 20% of the total wall area is accepted by doors and windows.

5. WAP to create a Person class having name, age and gender as instance variables. Write 3 contructors for contructor overloading like 
a. with no arguement
b. with all parameters
